# Setting up a vmpooler development environment

## Docker is the preferred development environment

The docker compose file is the easiest way to get vmpooler running with any local code changes. The docker compose file expects to find a vmpooler.yaml configuration file in the root vmpooler directory. The file is mapped into the running container for the vmpooler application. This file primarily contains the pools configuration. Nearly all other configuration can be supplied with environment variables.

## Requirements for local installation directly on your system (not recommended)

* Supported on OSX, Windows and Linux

* Ruby or JRuby

  Note - It is recommended to user Bundler instead of installing gems into the system repository

* A local Redis server

  Either a containerized instance of Redis or a local version is fine.

## Setup source and ruby

* Clone repository, either from your own fork or the original source

* Perform a bundle install

```
~/ > git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/vmpooler.git
Cloning into 'vmpooler'...
remote: Counting objects: 3411, done.
...

~/ > cd vmpooler

~/vmpooler/ > bundle install

Fetching version metadata from https://rubygems.org/..

Installing rake 12.0.0
...
Bundle complete! 16 Gemfile dependencies, 37 gems now installed.
```

## Setup environment variables

### `VMPOOLER_DEBUG`

Setting the `VMPOOLER_DEBUG` environment variable will instruct vmpooler to:

* Output log messages to STDOUT

* Allow the use of the dummy authentication method

* Add interrupt traps so you can stop vmpooler when run interactively

Linux, OSX
```bash
~/vmpooler/ > export VMPOOLER_DEBUG=true
```

Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
C:\vmpooler > $ENV:VMPOOLER_DEBUG = 'true'
```


### `VMPOOLER_CONFIG`

When `VMPOOLER_CONFIG` is set, vmpooler will read its configuration from the content of the environment variable.

Note that this variable does not point to a different configuration file, but stores the contents of a configuration file. You may use `VMPOOLER_CONFIG_FILE` instead to specify a filename.


### `VMPOOLER_CONFIG_FILE`

When `VMPOOLER_CONFIG_FILE` is set, vmpooler will read its configuration from the file specified in the environment variable.

Note that this variable points to a different configuration file, unlike `VMPOOLER_CONFIG`.


## Setup vmpooler Configuration

You can create a `vmpooler.yaml` file, set the `VMPOOLER_CONFIG` environment variable with the equivalent content, or set the `VMPOOLER_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable with the name of another configuration file to use. `VMPOOLER_CONFIG` takes precedence over `VMPOOLER_CONFIG_FILE`.

Example minimal configuration file:
```yaml

---
:providers:
  :dummy:

:redis:
  server: 'localhost'

:auth:
   provider: dummy

:tagfilter:
  url: '(.*)\/'

:config:
  site_name: 'vmpooler'
  # Need to change this on Windows
  logfile: '/var/log/vmpooler.log'
  task_limit: 10
  timeout: 15
  vm_lifetime: 12
  vm_lifetime_auth: 24
  allowed_tags:
    - 'created_by'
    - 'project'
  domain: 'example.com'
  prefix: 'poolvm-'

# Uncomment the lines below to suppress metrics to STDOUT
# :statsd:
#   server: 'localhost'
#   prefix: 'vmpooler'
#   port: 8125

:pools:
  - name: 'pool01'
    size: 5
    provider: dummy
  - name: 'pool02'
    size: 5
    provider: dummy
```

## Running vmpooler locally

* Run `bundle exec ruby vmpooler`

  If using JRuby, you may need to use `bundle exec jruby vmpooler`

You should see output similar to:
```
~/vmpooler/ > bundle exec ruby vmpooler

### Common Errors

* Forget to set VMPOOLER_DEBUG environment variable

vmpooler will fail to start with an error similar to below
```
~/vmpooler/ > bundle exec ruby vmpooler

~/vmpooler/lib/vmpooler.rb:44:in `config': Dummy authentication should not be used outside of debug mode; please set environment variable VMPOOLER_DEBUG to 'true' if you want to use dummy authentication (RuntimeError)
        from vmpooler:8:in `<main>'
...
```

* Error in vmpooler configuration

If there is an error in the vmpooler configuration file, or any other fatal error in the Pool Manager, vmpooler will appear to be running but no log information is displayed.  This is due to the error not being displayed until you press `Ctrl-C` and then suddenly you can see the cause of the issue.

For example, when running vmpooler on Windows, but with a unix style filename for the vmpooler log

```powershell
C:\vmpooler > bundle exec ruby vmpooler
[2017-06-16 14:49:57] starting vmpooler
== Sinatra (v1.4.8) has taken the stage on 4567 for production with backup from Puma

## Default vmpooler URLs

| Endpoint  | URL                                                                  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dashboard | [http://localhost:4567/dashboard/](http://localhost:4567/dashboard/) |
| API       | [http://localhost:4567/api/v1]([http://localhost:4567/api/v1)        |

## Use the vmpooler API locally

Once a local vmpooler instance is running you can use any tool you need to interact with the API.  The dummy authentication provider will allow a user to connect if the username and password are not the same:

* Authentication is successful for username `Alice` with password `foo`

* Authentication will fail for username `Alice` with password `Alice`

Like normal vmpooler, tokens will be created for the user and can be used for regular vmpooler operations.
